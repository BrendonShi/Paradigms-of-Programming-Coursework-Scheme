# Mastermind Code Breaker (Racket)
This project is a code-breaking game, similar to Mastermind, implemented in the Racket programming language. The player's objective is to guess a secret code generated by the computer within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating how many numbers are correct in both value and position, and how many are correct in value but in the wrong position.

# Features
- Secret Code Generation: The game can generate a random secret code of a specified length using a given list of possible numbers.

- Player Guessing: A simple interface allows the player to input their guess.

- Input Validation: The game checks if the player's guess is valid according to the game's rules (e.g., correct length, valid numbers).

- Feedback System: For each guess, the game provides feedback on:

- Black pegs: The number of digits that are correct in both value and position.

- Game Loop: The game continues until the player either guesses the code correctly or runs out of attempts.
